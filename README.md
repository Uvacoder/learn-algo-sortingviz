# Sorting Visualizer

We are all aware of many sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and so on, but we frequently fail to comprehend the algorithms due to a lack of visual information. This React Web-App will assist you in visualising these algorithms for better understanding. I started this project because I was always fascinated that the concept of organization could be so easily captured within algorithms, as well as the fact that some core mathematical principles can make some incredibly-fast algorithms.

Check out our App at [Sorting Visualizer](https://effortless-llama-edff71.netlify.app/)

## Demo

## Features

- Vary the pace and length of array
- Able to randomize arrays 
- Select several sorting algorithms to visualise with their time and space complexity. 
- Link to an article on these sorting methods so that you can easily learn and see them at the same time.

## Future Scope of Improvement

- Make it responsive
- Add more sorting algorithms to our project
- Run all the algorithms together for the same array to actually understand the time complexity.
- Vary speed when sorting is in process
